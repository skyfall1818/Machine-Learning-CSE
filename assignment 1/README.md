files needed: ML_Model.py, teacher.py, tictactoe\ machine\ learning.py, training_examples.txt
    all files need to be placed in the same folder

To run the program. type: "python3 tictactoe\ machine\ learning.py"
    on startup, the program gives multiple options to play: (1-Play Against ML_Model | 2-Play Against Teacher | 3-Test ML Model | 4-Print Weights | 5-Quit)
    input the number that correspond to the action you want to play.
    Note: the 1 input sends you into another menu to decide which model (teacher/ direct (1) or no teacher/indirect (2)) you want to play against
    selecting an opponent will lead to a menu asking to pick going first (1) or second (2)

the training examples.txt holds the examples that the teacher selects to train the model.
    this can be regenerated by typing "python3 teacher.py"
